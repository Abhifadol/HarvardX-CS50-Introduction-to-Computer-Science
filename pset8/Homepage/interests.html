            <h2>My interests</h2>
            <p>Well, my interests are probably extremely normal for my age,
            however, I use them to fill this website with data instead of boring
            lorem ipsum text. I will probably make a list with my interests just to take up
            more space. I will also try to implement some sort of form.</p>
