# HarvardX-CS50-Introduction-to-Computer-Science
  I made this repository to post my solutions to Harvard University's [2020 CS50 intro course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) assignments and document my progress during the course.

  You can find the materials for the course [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) or look at the assignments specifications linked at right of every section in the table of contents.

  Hope this is helpful to other students, you are free to contact me for any question or clarification. Every exercise in this repository scored 100% on submission.
